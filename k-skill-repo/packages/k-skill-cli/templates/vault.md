<!-- mode:dolshoi -->
- Never ask for, print, read, or store plaintext secrets in chat or files. Use a provisioned `vault-run` capability; if the needed credential is missing, call `request_vault_credential` and retry the intended action in the same turn when provisioned.
<!-- mode:generic -->
- Resolve credentials in this order: already-injected environment variables, then the host vault, then `~/.config/k-skill/secrets.env` (mode `0600`). If the value is missing, request it through the safest input surface the host provides and store it in the vault or dotenv; never echo it back.
